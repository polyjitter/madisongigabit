                    <p>The standard limitations apply: the Internet is like driving your car around. Some roads are faster than others. Some times of day are faster than others. Sometimes there's a slowdown for no reason you can see, and suddenly it clears up. Usually slowdowns won't be on us.</p>
                    <p>The rated speed of the network is not the same as the download speed you can see various places. Remember: 8 bits equals one byte. Network speed is in bits and your data is in bytes.</p>
                    <p>Want to download a movie? Please do it overnight, or in the afternoon. If everyone tries to do this at 8pm, it's going to be like I-495 rush-hour.</p>

                    <h2>Is it really possible to reach that top speed?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes, but there are caveats and it's admittedly not frequent.</p>
                    <p>Remember bumper cars at Kings Dominion? You all go around in a loop, but you do bump into other things a lot. Sometimes
                    it's pretty smooth looping, sometimes not. If you were on the track all alone, and there aren't any other cars, well, yes,
                    you can hit pretty close to top speed.</p>
                    <p>Network traffic travels in "packets" where a packet carries a bunch of "bytes" but also has a lot of "overhead" (extra bytes having to do with destination and routing and stuff); that overhead is about 1/3 of the actual bits that get on the network. Your DVD movie download of 2 gigaBYTES (aka 16 gigaBITS) is going to take about 25 gigaBITS on the network, and recent experience suggests that will, under the best possible circumstances, take about a minute.</p>
                    <p>Here's an option for you: <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">Click here to do a speed test</a> of the service you already have. The numbers you get will vary with time of day. Middle of the night is definitely going to be faster; 4pm, not so much. Today, at 10 pm, I got (ping) 632,
                    (Down) 2.52, (Up) 0.73, on satellite. On your cellphone you'll have to download an app from speedtest to measure that. With
                    2 bars of Sprint LTE I got 681, 1.75, and 1.69. For these numbers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Ping</b> <i>(Latency)</i> - Smaller is better</li>
                        <li><b>Down</b> <i>(Download Speed)</i> - Larger is better</li>
                        <li><b>Up</b> <i>(Upload Speed)</i> - Larger is better</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Preferably, down and up should be as close as possible.</p>
                    <p>Madison Gigabit intends that our service numbers will be 5,850,850. We'll see how that turns out 😊</p>
                    <p>My best experience recently is that when I direct-connected a pair of computers with a gigabit wire was that I moved about 2 gigaBYTES per minute; the test was actually about 25 gigabytes and it took about 12 minutes. So I expect that's the real peak speed we can hope for. I have gotten faster than that, nearly 3 gigaBYTES per minute, with faster computers (or perhaps it was faster internal disks).</p>

                    <h2>What is this going to cost?</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                     <p>The target is $75 per month. That will be all the features we care about - full gigabit speed, no data limit. FIOS in Richmond is that price, for their gigabit service, with their infrastructure and population density. If we need a cheaper price per month it won't be gigabit.</p>
                     <p>May be possible: 10 gigabit speed service for some nearby customers/users. That's going to be pricey, maybe $500 per month, because that is requiring fancier hardware that costs more. After 5-10 years (sooner if possible), that will becomethe standard service speed. We aren't trying to do this yet, and won't for a few years at the least.</p>
                     <p>Eventually, of course, we will be aiming for fiber direct to all homes in the county. That's going to be pricey, too. The fiber itself is about 50 cents per foot, but the labor cost is ~$5 per foot.</p>

                        <li>Pull fiber to the named villages (Syria, Etlan, Rochelle, Hood, etc). Either use very high-speed wireless from there, as repeaters, and receivers at homes, or fiber all the way. Cost swag $10 million.</li>
                        <li>Continue to pull fiber until that reaches every household. Cost swag $10 million.</li>

                <p>What we don't know yet is whether the wireless/repeaters approach is any cheaper than fiber everywhere. It might not be.</p>
                <p>Basically, we will begin with some very fast wireless, and back-fill with fiber as we push out of town and as customers are
